# Aura_LLM

Aura_LLM is a passion project aimed at building a custom Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using only PyTorch. The focus of this model is to explore, understand, and generate content related to spiritual knowledge and consciousness — an area referred to here as "Aura Knowledge."

## 🌟 Project Vision

The objective of Aura_LLM is to create a purpose-driven language model that specializes in:
- Understanding spiritual texts and philosophies.
- Generating insights rooted in mindfulness, meditation, and metaphysics.
- Providing intelligent, ethical, and spiritually-aware responses.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: PyTorch (no Hugging Face or external LLM libraries)
- **Language**: Python
- **Training**: Built-from-scratch tokenizers, transformers, and training loop
- **Deployment**: Local experimentation (initially), later plans for minimal web interface

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Custom tokenizer
- Transformer blocks (Multi-head self-attention + Feed-forward)
- Positional encoding
- LayerNorm, Dropout, Residual connections
- Optimizer: Adam / AdamW
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss (for autoregressive LM)

## 📚 Dataset

The model will be trained on a curated dataset of:
- Ancient scriptures (e.g., Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, Tao Te Ching)
- Modern spiritual discourses
- Meditative writings and consciousness research

## 🚀 Status

- [x] Project initialized
- [x] Tokenizer logic complete
- [x] Initial transformer blocks implemented
- [ ] Dataset preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Training loop
- [ ] Evaluation on spiritual QA
- [ ] Inference interface

## 🙏 Purpose

This model isn't just about NLP — it's about merging modern AI with timeless wisdom. Aura_LLM seeks to be a mindful machine: a guide, not a guru.
